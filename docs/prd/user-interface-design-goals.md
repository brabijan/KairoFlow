# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a calm, distraction-free interface that presents critical information without overwhelming ADHD users. Use visual hierarchy, color coding for urgency, and progressive disclosure to manage cognitive load while ensuring nothing important can be missed.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

• **Zero-friction actions:** Maximum 2 clicks from notification to completed action
• **Visual urgency indicators:** Color-coded deadlines (green→yellow→red) impossible to ignore
• **Batch operations:** Group similar tasks (e.g., show all QR codes on one screen)
• **Progressive disclosure:** Show only essential info first, details on demand
• **Gamification elements:** Streaks, progress bars, buffer "health bar"

## Core Screens and Views

• **Daily Dashboard:** Morning check screen with financial status and urgent items
• **Payment Queue:** List of pending payments with QR codes and deadlines  
• **Task Inbox:** Unprocessed work tasks from Slack/email not yet in GitLab
• **Cash Flow Visualizer:** Weekly income vs expenses with buffer tracking
• **Quick Actions:** One-click access to common operations (generate QRs, mark paid)
• **Settings:** Email configuration, category management, ADHD strategy toggles

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility for future expansion.

## Branding

Clean, minimal design with calming colors. No aggressive red alerts. Use subtle animations for positive feedback. Emoji usage minimal and purposeful (✓ for completed, ⚠️ for warnings).

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Desktop-first design optimized for morning routine on laptop/desktop. Fully responsive for mobile checking throughout the day.
