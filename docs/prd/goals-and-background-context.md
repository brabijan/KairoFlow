# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

• Eliminate all late payment penalties within 2 months (currently 500-2000+ CZK/month)
• Build a weekly financial buffer starting at 500 CZK with 10% weekly growth
• Capture 95%+ of work tasks in GitLab within 24 hours of receipt
• Automate 100% of follow-up tasks from deployments
• Create an ADHD-friendly system requiring minimal active participation
• Enable systematic debt reduction (minimum 5% of monthly income)
• Provide emotionally neutral financial management without guilt or shame
• Achieve daily interaction streak of 80%+ through gamification

## Background Context

KairoFlow addresses the intersection of ADHD executive dysfunction and financial illiteracy that creates a destructive cycle of late payments, penalties, and mounting stress. Traditional financial and task management tools fail because they require consistent discipline and active maintenance - precisely what ADHD brains struggle with. This system takes a radically different approach: instead of fighting ADHD, it works around it through automation, multi-channel bypass strategies, and progressive habit building. By centralizing all inputs through a dedicated email hub and using AI-powered processing, the system eliminates the need for manual data entry while providing friction-free actions (2-click payments via QR codes) and unavoidable reminders that bypass procrastination.
