    notes: 'Secrets properly managed but missing network policies and security scanning. Default passwords in templates pose minor risk.'

    status: PASS

  reliability:

    notes: 'Well-organized Helm chart with comprehensive documentation and CI/CD automation'

recommendations:
  immediate:  # Should address before production
    - action: 'Add Helm chart validation tests'
      refs: ['helm/kairoflow/templates/tests/']
      rationale: 'Ensure deployments are verified automatically'
    - action: 'Replace default passwords with required values or deployment-time generation'
      refs: ['helm/kairoflow/templates/database-secret.yaml', 'helm/kairoflow/templates/redis-secret.yaml']
      rationale: 'Prevent accidental deployment with insecure defaults'
  future:  # Can be addressed in next iteration
    - action: 'Implement NetworkPolicy for pod isolation'
      refs: ['helm/kairoflow/templates/networkpolicy.yaml']
      rationale: 'Enhance security by restricting pod-to-pod communication'
    - action: 'Add container security scanning to CI/CD'
      refs: ['.github/workflows/docker-build.yml']
      rationale: 'Identify vulnerabilities in container images before deployment'
    - action: 'Configure HorizontalPodAutoscaler'
      refs: ['helm/kairoflow/templates/hpa.yaml']
      rationale: 'Enable automatic scaling based on load'
    - action: 'Add PodDisruptionBudget'
      refs: ['helm/kairoflow/templates/pdb.yaml']
      rationale: 'Ensure availability during cluster maintenance'
